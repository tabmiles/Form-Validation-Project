# Form Validation Project
Course Project for CS 321 Web-Centric Programming

By: Tabitha Miles, Danielle Alexandre, and Eva Lynch

# Guiding Question
What would a registration page for an airline frequent flyer program look like?

# Objectives
* Decide what information and questions should go on the form
* Group the items and choose fieldsets and legends
* Create an appropriate visual design for the form
* Code the form, including labels
* Make sure the form is accessible
* Broad design of the validating function
* Decide how to handle incorrect or missing input (i.e. an invalid entry)
* Validate checkboxes and radio buttons, required fields, dates (e. g. no Feb. 30), text boxes and nunbers
* Ensure that if there is invalid input, it is corrected and no error messages show

# Form Requirements
The form should collect the following:
* Family and given names (both required)
* Home address including a drop down list for states & country (U.S.)
* Date of birth â€“ please use drop down lists or a date finder (required)
* Telephone number(s) 
* Radio buttons to choose a salutation (Mr./ Ms./ Dr./Rev./and n/a)
* An email (required)
* Check boxes for at least three other question of your own choosing that you think an airline might include
* A password and confirm password (using the password type so that the characters are hidden)
* At least one field which asks users to enter a number (not from a drop-down list & which you will validate as a number and have min and max allowable values)

Questions should be grouped using fieldsets and legends and required fields need to be inform blind users.
